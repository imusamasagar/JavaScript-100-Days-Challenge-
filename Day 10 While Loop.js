// Lecture 10 while loops

// while loop
let n = prompt("Enter the value of n")
n = Number.parseInt(n)
// syntax is as initialize outside the bracket then while with a condition ahead then after bracket increment the while loop can run untill the condition is false do if you give that condition that dont false your code will crash

let i = 0;
while(i<n){
  console.log(i)
  i++;
}
